ScalaZ3 for Scala 2.10
======================

This is ScalaZ3 for Scala 2.10 and Z3 4.3. Switch to the branch '2.9.x' for
Scala 2.9 support.


Downloading Z3
=================

Z3 can be downloaded from the [Z3 download site](http://z3.codeplex.com/)


Compiling ScalaZ3
=================

Setup steps, for Linux
----------------------

1) Download Z3, and copy the include and lib files to z3/[z3version]/include and
z3/[z3version]/lib respectively. (eg: z3/4.3-unix-64b/include/z3.h and
z3/4.3-unix-64b/lib/libz3.so).

2) Download sbt 0.12.x.

3) Run 'sbt package' to create the jar file. It will be in
target/[scalaversion]/scalaz3....jar and will contain the shared
library required by the bindings.

4) For testing, run

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=z3/[z3version]/lib sbt test

Alternatively, start a console by running

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=z3/[z3version]/lib scala -cp target/[scalaversion]scalaz3.jar

then try, e.g.,

    println(z3.scala.version).

Setup steps, for Mac
----------------------

1) Download Z3, and copy the include and lib files to z3/[z3version]/include and
z3/[z3version]/lib respectively. (eg: z3/4.3-osx-64b/include/z3.h and
z3/4.3-osx-64b/lib/libz3.so).

2) Download sbt 0.12.x.

3) Run 'sbt package' to create the jar file. It will be in
target/[scalaversion]/scalaz3....jar and will contain the shared
library required by the bindings.

4) For testing, run

    DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=z3/[z3version]/lib sbt test

Alternatively, start a console by running

    DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=z3/[z3version]/lib scala -cp target/[scalaversion]scalaz3.jar

then try, e.g.,

    println(z3.scala.version).

Setup steps, for Windows
------------------------

A) Download and install Z3 using the .msi installer

B) Download sbt (see 2 above).

C) The 'package' command in the current build script does not work with
Windows; there is no equivalent for the gcc command. Run 'javah' so that it
compiles the Java/Scala sources and generates the JNI header files.

D) Assuming you have copied the 'include' and 'bin' directories from the Z3
distribution in z3/[z3version], the following command should compile the shared
library, assuming you have installed MinGW:

    gcc -shared -o lib-bin\scalaz3.dll -D_JNI_IMPLEMENTATION_ -Wl,--kill-at -I "[jdkpath]\include" -I "[jdkpath]\include\win32" -I z3\[z3version]\include src\c\*.h src\c\*.c z3\[z3version]\bin\z3.lib

E) You can manually create a jar with the contents of target/[scalaversion] and
lib-bin.
